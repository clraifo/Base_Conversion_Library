# Base_Conversion_Library
A simple C++ library that allows conversion from any base number systems to any other

BaseConverter.h does the heavy actual math work
BaseConvertor.cpp is a simple one-run testing source fil; that does this:

        Enter the base of the input number: 16
        Enter the number to convert: ffff
        Enter the base of the output number: 3
        ffff (base 16) = 10022220020 (base 3)

Just add the header file to your source repo and add 

        #include "BaseConverter.h"

to the header. Enjoy!
